They claim to be unbeatable, and now it's your chance to prove them wrong. Dive into their web server, find the hidden flags, and show the world your elite hacking skills. Good luck, and may the best hacker win!  <br>But beware, this won't be a walk in the digital park. Hack Smarter Security has fortified the server against common attacks and their password policy requires passwords that have not been breached (they check it against the rockyou.txt wordlist - that's how 'cool' they are). The hacking gauntlet has been thrown, and it's time to elevate your game. Remember, only the most ingenious will rise to the top.&nbsp;<br>May your code be swift, your exploits flawless, and victory&nbsp;yours!<br>Make sure you wait a full 5 minutes after you start the machine before scanning or doing any enumeration. This will make sure all the services have started.<br><br>IP Address: 10.10.206.48<br><br>First off, let's perform a NMAP scan against the server to see all the open ports<br>sudo nmap -sC -sV -T5 -vv 10.10.206.48 -oA Nmap/Silver_Platter.nmap

<br>The Open ports are:<br>
<br>Port 22 - SSH
<br>Port 80 - Web Server
<br>Port 8080 - Probably a Web Server
<br>So, to access the Web Application, let's add the domain name to our /etc/hosts file<br>10.10.206.48 silver_platter.thm
<br><br>First, let's try accessing the server's application at port 80.<br>Here under the #contact page, we see a username being displayed to us.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113195426.png" src="pasted-image-20250113195426.png"><br>Other than that, there is no information that is useful to us.<br><br>By fuzzing the Application for files, folders and vhosts, we got not useful and satisfying results from them.<br>ffuf -w ~/Pranava__Rao/Tools/Fuzzing-List/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-files.txt -u "http://silver_platter.thm/FUZZ"
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113195904.png" src="pasted-image-20250113195904.png"><br>ffuf -w ~/Pranava__Rao/Tools/Fuzzing-List/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -u "http://silver_platter.thm/FUZZ"
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113200600.png" src="pasted-image-20250113200600.png"><br>ffuf -w ~/Pranava__Rao/Tools/Fuzzing-List/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u "http://silver_platter.thm/" -H "HOST:FUZZ.silver_platter.thm" -fw 926
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113200807.png" src="pasted-image-20250113200807.png"><br><br>Now, since there is no useful output from the Port 80 web application, let's try to access the application at Port 8080.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113195752.png" src="pasted-image-20250113195752.png"><br>Here, we see an error saying 404 - Not Found, which means that the index pages or any of the related pages are not found, now, for this, let's fuzz for files.<br>ffuf -w ~/Pranava__Rao/Tools/Fuzzing-List/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -u "http://silver_platter.thm:8080/FUZZ"
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113201431.png" src="pasted-image-20250113201431.png"><br>Here we get some directories present in the server, but not much of an use to us.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113201546.png" src="pasted-image-20250113201546.png"><br>after some time, looking back the PORT 80 application, I notice the reference of Silverpeas, which happened to be an application for contacting people.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113201839.png" src="pasted-image-20250113201839.png"><br>I tried accessing the silverpease application in the port 80 application, but then failed, but, we could get a login page in the port 8080 page.<br>http://silver_platter.thm:8080/silverpeas
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113203558.png" src="pasted-image-20250113203558.png"><br>Here, we are greeted with the login Page of silverpease, we might have found the username as scr1ptkiddy, but we are supposed to find the password to this username.<br>And according to the challenge description, they have disallowed any passwords that have been breached, which means that we can't find any passwords from the rockyou.txt file.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113204207.png" src="pasted-image-20250113204207.png"><br>So, to get some passwords, let' use cewl tool to generate some password using the contents of the Port 80 web application.<br>cewl http://silver_platter.thm/ &gt; Passwords.txt
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113204533.png" src="pasted-image-20250113204533.png"><br>Now, using this wordlist, let's try to crack the password of the web application using ffuf<br>ffuf -w ./Passwords.txt -u "http://silver_platter.thm:8080/silverpeas/AuthenticationServlet" -X POST -d "Login=scr1ptkiddy&amp;Password=FUZZ&amp;DomainId=0" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -r -mc all -fs 8282
<br>And Here we get the password:<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113211320.png" src="pasted-image-20250113211320.png"><br>With this password, let's try to log into the application.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113211422.png" src="pasted-image-20250113211422.png"><br>Once loggedin to the application, we see no useful information to go forward, so, let's look for a public exploit for this application's service.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113214002.png" src="pasted-image-20250113214002.png"><br>Here we see that we have access to most of the log log files<br>while looking at all the log files, we see an interesting file part of the log, where we see a password of the root user to a docker run by tyler<br>grep -Ri "password" /var/log/ 2&gt;/dev/null
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113215133.png" src="pasted-image-20250113215133.png"><br>Now, let's try this password to the tyler user.<br>su - tyler
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250113220025.png" src="pasted-image-20250113220025.png"><br>Now, since the tyler user is a part of the sudo group, we can now shift to the root user.<br>sudo su -
